## Assignment

Predicting the `Attrition Flag` response variable from the [Credit Card costumers dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers ) available on Kaggle.\
The dataset can be found in the `datasets/` folder.\
Other projects based on this dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/code).

## About the dataset

A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction

I got this dataset from the [leaps.analyttica wesite](https://leaps.analyttica.com/home). I have been using this for a while to get datasets and accordingly work on them to produce fruitful results. The site explains how to solve a particular business problem.

Now, this dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are nearly 18 features.

We have only 16.07% of customers who have churned. Thus, it's a bit difficult to train our model to predict churning customers.

## Dataset Summary

Here is a brief summary of what the dataset contains.

> [!WARNING]
> **PLEASE IGNORE THE LAST 2 COLUMNS (NAIVE BAYES CLASâ€¦). I SUGGEST TO RATHER DELETE IT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>A business manager of a consumer credit card portfolio is facing the problem of customer attrition. They want to analyze the data to find out the reason behind this and leverage the same to predict customers who are likely to drop off.

## Importing the dataset

To import and use the dataset in an R script or R Markdown file, use the following code.

```r
# Set working directory as this directory
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))

# Load the dataset from the datasets/ folder
bank <- read.csv("path/to/datasets/BankChurners.csv", sep = ",")
```

## Preprocessing

>[!NOTE]
> The preprocessing steps can be found in the `r_scripts/preprocessing.r` file.

As suggested from the Kaggel description of the dataset, we removed the last two columns.

```r
# Remove the last two columns as suggested in the README
bank <- bank[, -c(22, 23)]
```

Then, we removed the `CLIENTNUM` column as it is just an identifier.

```r
# Remove the first column as it is just an index
bank <- bank[, -1]
```

After that, it was necessary to convert the `Attrition_Flag` column to a binary variable:

* `0` if the account is not closed, i.e. for the `Existing Customer` value
* `1` if the account is closed, i.e. for the `Attrited Customer` value

```r
# Convert the Attrition_Flag column to a binary variable
bank$Attrition_Flag <- ifelse(bank$Attrition_Flag == "Attrited Customer", 1, 0)
```

Accordingly all categorical variables were coverted to factors:

```r
# Convert all categorical variables to factors
bank$Gender <- as.factor(bank$Gender)
bank$Education_Level <- as.factor(bank$Education_Level)
bank$Marital_Status <- as.factor(bank$Marital_Status)
bank$Income_Category <- as.factor(bank$Income_Category)
bank$Card_Category <- as.factor(bank$Card_Category)
```

Luckily there were no missing values in the dataset, so we could proceed with the analysis.

## Logistic regression

>[!NOTE]
> The logistic regression can be found in the `r_scripts/logistic_regression.r` file.

### Feature Engineering

A model using logistic regression has been built to predict the `Attrition_Flag` response variable.\
In an initial phase the most relevant variables have been selected to build the model.\
The selection criteria used have been the following:

* Variables with a p-value lower than 0.05 in the `glm()` model summary have been selected
* Variables with low correlation with the response variable have been removed
* Using the `anova()` test, only the most significant variables (including categorical variables) have been selected
* To avoid multicollinearity, variables with low VIF have been selected

The final model has been built using the following variables:

* `Gender`: the gender of the customer
* `Marital_Status`: the marital status of the customer
* `Income_Category`: the income category of the customer
* `Total_Relationship_Count`: the total number of products held by the customer
* `Months_Inactive_12_mon`: the number of months inactive in the last 12 months
* `Contacts_Count_12_mon`: the number of contacts in the last 12 months
* `Total_Revolving_Bal`: the total revolving balance on the credit card
* `Total_Trans_Amt`: the total transaction amount in the last 12 months
* `Total_Trans_Ct`: the total transaction count in the last 12 months
* `Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1`: the change in transaction count from Q4 to Q1

The result of the ANOVA test is the following:

### Model assessment

In the relative `R` script, appropiate learning and prediction functions have been defined as well as methods to compute effectveness metrics on the whole dataset and performing a k-fold cross validation.\
The effectiveness metrics used so far are the following:

* Accuracy
* AUC
* FPR (False Positive Rate)
* FNR (False Negative Rate)
* Confusion matrix (*only in the whole dataset case*)
* AIC
* BIC

The Dummy classifier has been taken as a baseline for comparison.
